 * The customer tapping "แจ้งว่าโอนแล้ว" after scanning their PromptPay QR — just a claim (see

 * staff see as a "รอตรวจสอบยอดโอน" nudge; the real checkout/PAID status still only ever happens
 * through `CheckoutDialog` once staff has actually checked their own banking app. No auth, same
 * as the rest of the customer surface — worst case of a guessed/leaked order id here is a
 * misleading nudge on one order, never money moving or anything staff wouldn't double-check anyway.
